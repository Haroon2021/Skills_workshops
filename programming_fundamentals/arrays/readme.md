## Learning outcomes

##### By the end of this session, all developers can...
- Describe the basic structure of an array
- Add elements to an array
- Read elements from an array, based on their position
- Iterate over an array, using a method that takes a block
- Explain that there is a common pattern for methods that take blocks

## Exercises

1. Turn this `[[1,1,1,1], [2,2,2,2]]` into this `[4, 8]`
2. Select the odd numbers from this array `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`
3. `puts` each name that starts with 'S' from `['Sandy', 'Terrence','Susan', 'Humphrey, 'Simone', 'Englebert']`
4. Create a new array of these names in block caps `['Sandy', 'Terrence','Susan', 'Humphrey, 'Simone']`
5. Get user input and add whatever they say to an array, stop when they say 'stop' then `puts` the array
6. Look at the [docs][ruby_docs], find an interesting method and play with it
